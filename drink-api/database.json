Traditionally, it consists of tequila, which provides a robust and earthy backbone, mixed with grapefruit juice or grapefruit-flavored soda, which adds a tangy and slightly bitter twist. Lime juice is often included to enhance the citrus profile, and the drink is usually sweetened with a bit of simple syrup or agave nectar to round out the flavors.\n\nThe Paloma is typically served in a highball glass over ice and garnished with a slice of lime or a grapefruit wedge. Sometimes, the rim of the glass is salted, adding a savory contrast that complements the sweet and citrusy elements of the cocktail. It's considered a lighter alternative to the Margarita and is especially popular for its thirst-quenching qualities in warm climates.",
